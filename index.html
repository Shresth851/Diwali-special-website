    <h2><u>Brief introduction on Diwali:</h2></u>
    <p>
        Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant festivals celebrated by Hindus worldwide. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. During Diwali, homes and public spaces are adorned with oil lamps (diyas), rangoli designs, and colorful lights. The festival typically spans five days, with each day having its own rituals and traditions. Families come together to perform prayers (pujas), exchange gifts, enjoy festive meals, and burst fireworks. It's a time of joy, prosperity, and new beginnings, fostering a sense of community and togetherness.</p>

    <h2><u>History and Significance:</h2></u>
    <p>Diwali traces its roots back to ancient India, with multiple origins linked to different regions and traditions. One of the most popular stories is from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, which recounts the return of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and brother Lakshmana to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile. The citizens lit oil lamps to celebrate their homecoming, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.<br>

        Diwali also holds significance in other major Hindu texts. In the Mahabharata, it marks the day the Pandavas returned after 12 years of exile. Additionally, it celebrates the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura, symbolizing the destruction of evil.<br>
        
        For many, Diwali is also associated with the goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. Devotees perform rituals and prayers to invite Lakshmi into their homes, seeking her blessings for the year ahead.<br>
        
        Overall, Diwali transcends its mythological origins to symbolize new beginnings, the renewal of life, and the pursuit of knowledge and inner light. It’s a time of joy, family reunions, and the celebration of life's blessings.<br>
